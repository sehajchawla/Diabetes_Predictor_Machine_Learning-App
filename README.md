# Diabetes_Predictor_Machine_Learning-App
This app uses Newton's method and logistic regression to classify whether a person has diabetes. Numpy is the only dependency used.

The process for this project was as follows:
1. I first made my own data set and related it to a model, but with a variance of 1.
2. Then I used logistic regression and newton's method to predict the best model (which should obviously be the same as the model I first associated it with).
3. I then output the values of the Beta coefficients for the function that can be used to simply plug in the weight, height and blood pressure of a new datum and that will output the log(odds) of the probability of the datum having diabetes.


The output is attached in the screenshot
